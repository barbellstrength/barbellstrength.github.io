<p>One of the biggest mistakes I have noticed amongst people who are on their Weight-loss journey is that they try to lose ALL of their weight in one go. They never stop or take a break.</p>

<p>When we are in a caloric Deficit or Caloric Restricted state or simply when we are eating less food, a lot of negative or bad things happen in our body. </p>
<p>I am mentioning a few of them below:</p>

<blockquote>-	All the Bad hormones in our body Rise and all the good hormones drop down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-	Our metabolism drops.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-	Our energy levels drop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-	Our libido/sex drive drops.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-	Chances of muscle loss increase.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-	Our Strength in the workouts decreases.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-	Our adherence to diet decreases and cravings start to come up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-	Etc.</blockquote>


<p>In short our body becomes Catabolic. This usually happens when an athlete is in a caloric restricted state for a long period of time, say more than 16 weeks. I don't recommend more than 16 weeks of Cut/Fat loss phase to anyone. I, personally, do only 12 weeks of cut then take a diet break for 8 weeks and then start the cut again.</p>

<p><strong>Diet break:</strong> As the name suggest, diet break means taking a break from dieting. This is achieved by gradually increasing calories every week or every 3 days (reverse dieting) with the goal of maintaining Bodyweight. Diet break not only gives you a mental break, it also brings up those GOOD hormones which aid in fat loss and were suppressed during dieting. Here is an example, let's assume a male client trying to lose 20 kg of bodyweight.</p>

<p>If this client tries to lose all of his 20kgs in one go, he is going to be very disappointed because he just made an already hard task a whole lot harder. Below are the different options which can be applied in above situation:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>12 week cut followed by 8 weeks of diet break. Then repeat. One cycle will take 20 weeks.</li>
  <li>Lose 5 kg, and then maintain this new body weight for 4-8 weeks, repeat.</li>
  <li>If someone finds dieting very hard, they can choose to cut for 3 weeks and then take a 1 week diet break. Then repeat.</li>
  <li>You can also choose to cut for 2 weeks and then take a diet break for 2 weeks.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are plenty of ways you can include diet breaks in your weight-loss plan. There are a few things to remember though.</p>

<blockquote>1)	Diet break does not mean that you don't have to count calories and track your bodyweight. Like I mentioned before you are too slowly increase calories and the goal is to maintain the current bodyweight for the entirety of Diet-break (fluctuations of +/- 1 kg are acceptable).</blockquote>
<blockquote>2)	Diet break does not mean that you should stop training. You will still train but training volume will be lesser than Cutting phase.</blockquote>

<p>So, that was it on Diet breaks.</p>
